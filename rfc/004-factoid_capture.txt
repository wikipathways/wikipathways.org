= Factoid Capture Database =
This RFC describes the plan for a factoid capturing database. In this RFC, I will assume that we are going
to use BioPAX to store the factoids. By describing all required features and data types, we can decide whether 
this would be a good choice, or if we should look for other options (e.g. a custom SQL database schema).

== What is a factoid ==
Within the context of this RFC, a factoid is a simple biological fact, that can be expressed as:

C(A-B)

Where:
	A, B 	biological entities (gene, protein, metabolite, ...)
	-		relationship (e.g. interacts, activates, phosphorylates)
	C		context (e.g. disease state, cellular compartment, species, tissue, ...)

So a textual representation of a factoid could be:
"Protein X phosphorylates protein Y under oxidative stress in human"
    A          -              B                 C1             C2

== Factoid capturing ==
Factoid information is typically the result of experimental studies that are usually described as textual representation within a 
publication. This is an inefficient way to store this information, since the process of extracting such single facts from the 
publication is not trivial and error prone. The idea of factoid capture is to store the single facts in the form of the structured 
expression C(A-B) into a dedicated database along with publication of the finding. This would greatly enhance our ability to 
computationally derive or extend pathways directly from knowledge derived from experimental studies. It is also useful as an aid 
for researchers to keep up-to-date on a certain topic, since nowadays it's hard to keep up with the massive amounts of publications.

Similar to GenBank (for sequence) or GEO/ArrayExpress (for microarray data) a factoid database would have most power if journals 
would force/stimulate authors to store their findings as factoids upon publication. This way the database will contain a structured, 
manually curated (indirectly, by reviewers of the article), high quality representation of the current biological knowledge at systems level.

WikiPathways would have a connection to the factoid database and make use of it. For example, you can right-click a gene and query all 
factoids for a given context. The editor than automatically shows possible interactions that could extend the pathway. This way you 
could easily 'grow' a pathway directly from evidence from literature. You could also imagine that we could build a pathway from scratch, 
given a user query (e.g. a set of proteins and a context).

The initial content of the factoid databse could be derived from existing literature using textmining techniques, or existing 
databases, such as Reactome.

== Implementation ==
=== Annotation ===
All components of the factoid need to be annotated to biological databases. So if you want A to be the protein 'P53', 
it needs to point to the corresponding UniProt entry. This also holds for contexts, e.g. cellular locations must point 
to an ontology that defines all cellular locations. We should make a list of all possible entities 
that can be covered by A, B and C and find a database to annotate them to.

Table 1: Biological entities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Type						Database					BioPAX element
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gene						Ensembl, Entrez Gene		gene
Protein						UniProt						protein
DNA							EMBL (?)					dna
Metabolite/compound			ChEBI, PubChem, HMDB		smallMolecule
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** 'dna' is not a valid element for gene, as written in the BioPAX specification:
"This is not a 'gene', since gene is a genetic concept, not a physical entity. 
The concept of a gene may be added later in BioPAX." 'dna' is used to refer to
regions of dna sequence, e.g., promoter binding sites or entire chromosomes.
** 'gene' is being added as a new subclass of PhysicalEntity in BioPAX level 3

Table 2: Context
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Type						Database					BioPAX element
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Species						NCBI Taxonomy				bioSource (TAXON-XREF property)
Cellular location			Gene Ontology, OLS, OBO		openControlledVocabulary (CELLULAR-LOCATION property)
Drugs						EBIMed, MedLine druginfo	smallMolecule
Disease						Healthcentral, OLS, OBO				?
Tissue						?							bioSource (TISSUE property)
Pathway						OLS, OBO							
Evidence Codes				OLS, OBO					evidence (EVIDENCE-CODE property)
Cell Type					OLS, OBO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
** I propose going to one source for our ontology needs at this point. BioPAX
mentions both OBO and OLS as potential sources for their openControlledVocabulary.
We can work with whichever is easier to implement.
** OBO : http://obofoundry.org/
** OLS = Ontology Lookup Service

 - Disease: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=DOID
 - GO: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=GO

For interactions, we need an ontology to define the types of interactions. BioPAX is a good
canidate for this. We should list all interaction types and find out if BioPAX supports them

Table 3: Interactions

------------------------------------------------------
** I propose we simply use the BioPAX terms directly and provide examples
of more common terms as annotation.  Above is the list from BioPAX level 3
and common examples in parentheses.
** templateReaction and templateReactionRegulation replace old terms from earlier level 3 proposal.

=== Storage and database ===
Only when BioPAX contains all semantics we want to capture in factoids, we should use it to store the factoids.
Each factoid could then be a BioPAX snippet that we will store in a database.

A good way to assess whether this is possible would be to create some examples of BioPAX snippets that 
represent certain factoids. Below are some factoids with their BioPAX code:

* "Protein X, Y, Z form a complex when in the nucleus"
See: 004-factoid_capture_snippet01.txt

* "Protein X is transported to the nucleus by protein Y"
TODO

* "Protein X phosphorylates protein Y under oxidative stress in human"
TODO

TODO: think of more factoids, try to cover all types.

As you can see from the BioPAX examples, the snippets tend to become very large. Therefore we should
have some common pools of BioPAX elements that can be referred to. For exapmle, all unificationXRefs to UniProt,
the openControlledVocabulary to GO, and the proteins can be shared among factoids and should not be stored
in duplicate. This problem is very similar to what Reactome does, it would be useful to see how they handle this.

TODO: some open questions:
- can we easily query the factoids when they're stored in BioPAX (e.g. give me all factoids with Gene X)?
There should be XML/OWL query languages that are optimalized for these types of queries.
- Maybe there are even off the shell solutions for storing XML code as a queryable database?
You could think of a script that creates a relational database schema from the OWL specification.
- if storing XML would prove to be too slow and inefficient, maybe we should just design our own 
database schema and convert to BioPAX on the fly when needed.

=== User interface ===
==== Add and edit factoids ====
See Factoid_Capture_v2.jpg for an idea of what the interface could look like. The idea is to have a very slim
version of PV running as an applet and designed to enter and edit very basic reactions or factoids. We can 
provide templates to facilitate entry.  Entry parameters can be limited to what is supported by BioPAX. In
general, I think BioPAX should serve as our requirements guide to help constrain what we build and to ensure
that the factiod that are entered can actually be distributed and exchanged as BioPAX.  In addition to the
PV window we could add little widgets to select ontology terms to provide context for each factoid.  We should
find a widget that will work for both this Factoid Capture project and WikiPathways (see SMD's Ontology Widget
http://smd.stanford.edu/ontologyWidget/OntologyWidgetHelp.htm). We should store the selections as both BioPAX 
and GPML (for WikiPathways). Finally, there is a description section.  I think we could produce an automatically
generated sentence from all the information entered.  This would serve as a "double check" for users to make
sure what they've drawn has the meaning they intend.  In addition, there would be a free text section for a
description in the user's own words and an area for references.  We might be able to recycle our WP applets for 
these last two items.

Entering factoids could be computationally guided: the user provides a text (e.g. article excerpt), we try
to guess the entities and context by using Whatizit. User can choose from these entities and edit or
add manually.

==== Query factoids ====
"Give me all factoids that contain Protein X in context Y"
"Give me all factoids that describe a phosphorylation of Protein Y in human"

TODO: think of some other queries we would like to perform

=== Programmers interface ===
It would be useful to hava a programmers interface to the factoid database. This would be needed
if we are going to query the database from WikiPathways, or programatically fill the database with
initial content. We could define a SOAP interface
that should be able to handle the following actions:
- retrieve factoids by ID
- retrieve factoids by query
- add new factoids

== Other discussion points ==
* Factoids should support dependencies:
For example, factoid A can only happen after factoid B. In BioPAX this is possible by defining
pathway steps, but I'm not sure this is the way to go.
