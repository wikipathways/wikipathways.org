= Release Management =

This document intends to formalize the following things:
* How to keep the test site and the stable site in sync
* How to do releases, and when to do them.

The proposal in this text is not set in stone, neither is it the only right way to do things. 
Adjustments may be necessary in the future.
But the most important thing here is that the procedure is documented and adhered to by all developers.

We have two sites:
* test    -> this is where development and most testing takes place
* stable  -> this is what the regular user sees

There are 6 types of data to take into account
* Pathway content
* other content data (pages, layout, Help, FAQ)
* user account data
* applet code
* mediawiki code
* wpi plugin code

Both sites are completely independent: they each have their own copy of all 6 types.

== Release schedule ==

All developement should take place on the test site *first*. 
Periodically, we want to sync the test site with the stable site. We want to keep the period between 
syncs short, around 4-6 weeks is ideal.

I propose that we define simple milestones for each period, and that we sync afterwards. 
We can keep to a schedule like this one:

* 3-4 weeks of development
* feature freeze
* 1-2 weeks of testing
* milestone release & sync

Each milestone should be preceded by a feature freeze, a period of 1-2 weeks where only bugfixes are allowed.
Work on major features should be started just after the milestone, so there is enough time to 
finish it before the feature freeze.

Features and bugs can be assigned to specific milestones, so we can plan a bit ahead to see which
features and bugs are going to be fixed when. 
For example:

Our development plan for the coming weeks: 

See

http://conklinwolf.ucsf.edu/genmappwiki/WikiPathways_Plan

for all the dates

The goal is to have a web meeting just before the Milestone, so we can 
go through the list of outstanding bugs together and see if there is any important
work remaining before the release.

To keep track of which features / bugs are going to be implemented / fixed for each milestone,
we use our bug tracker. The bug tracker will be used for bugs as well as features, so
it's probably best to speak of "issues" and "issue tracker".

A subproject will be created for each milestone. For example, right now we have

subprojects of project "wikipathways"

- wikipathways_milestone_1
- wikipathways_milestone_2
- wikipathawys_milestone_3

If you think you can fix an issue for a certain date, move the issue to that particular
subproject and assign it to yourself. Issues that are unassigned should go in the main project. 

If you are unsure when something should be fixed, or if it is too unimportant to fix right
now, just leave it in the main project wikipathways and we'll put it in a milestone
when we get around to it.

I still think that mantis doesn't support this workflow terribly well. However, it works
so we'll make do.

Since PathVisio and the WikiPathways applet share the same code base, this means that PathVisio 
will have to follow this schedule as well and will have to adhere to the Feature Freeze period. 
Likewise, there are milestone subprojects for pathvisio as well.

=== Pathway content ===

* Should be backed up daily on the stable site.
* the complete test site is considered a sandbox with regards to the Pathways. 
  The pathways on the test site may be deleted, changes may be reverted, nonsensical pathways may be added. 
  Never make any changes to Pathway content on the test site if you want to keep it.
* Periodically, the pathways from the test site may be reset, i.e. overwritten with the pathways from the stable site.

=== Page & layout data ===

We've experienced that copying over releasing page & layout data together with the release is cumbersome. 
So instead we will make changes directly to the stable site, possibly using the test site as a staging ground.

* Make the change directly on the stable site
** for most changes

* Make the change on the test site first, then copy over to the main site
** for changes that require review & discussion before going live
** for changes that depend on features that are not yet available on the main site

In either case this is independent of the release cycle. If you make a change to the test site with
the intention of copying over to the main site later, it is your responsibility to keep track of this.

=== User account data ===

User accounts on both sites are separate and never synced. If you want to have an account on both sites, you
should make two accounts. If you want to block a user on both sites, you have to block twice. The list of
users on the stable site is most important, of course. 
The test site should have accounts for developers and beta testers only.

If there are a lot of blocked users, they might bias the site statistics. Once in a while, blocked users can be deleted.
You can use e.g. this SQL statement
	
	DELETE user, ipblocks FROM user, ipblocks WHERE ipblocks.ipb_user =
user.user_id;

=== applet code ===

* on the test site: running trunk (or very close to it)
* may be updated on test site anytime

  Tip: to update the applets on the test site, run these commands (on the server)
  
  # ~/code/pathvisio-trunk is the staging ground, where everything will be compiled
  cd ~/code/pathvisio-trunk
  svn update
  cd trunk
  # compile & copy to site
  ant install-wpi -Dwikipathways.dest=/var/www/wikipathways-test -propertyfile ../ant.properties

* on the stable site: always running a release tag

  Tip: to update the applet on the stable site to the latest tag, run this:

  # keep staging ground up-to-date
  cd ~/code/pathvisio-release
  svn switch http://svn.bigcat.unimaas.nl/pathvisio/tags/milestone_nn.n
  # compile & copy to site
  ant install-wpi -Dwikipathways.dest=/var/www/wikipathways -propertyfile ../ant.properties

* make point releases when serious bugs occur in the middle of the release cycle.


whenever time for a release comes:
* start by making a release branch from the (tested) trunk. 
  The release branch is considered stable and should not be developed further except for important bugfixes.
  The release branch is named e.g. milestone_12.x. The letter x denotes that this branch is the offspring for all minor releases milestone_12.0, milestone_12.1, etc.
* then make a release tag from the release branch. Start with milestone_12.0
* if necessary, fix bugs in the branch. 
  Only do this for major bugs! 
  Since our release cycle is short, people should never have to wait for more than 6 weeks for the next release anyway, 
  so any bug that can wait that long should be fixed in the trunk and in the trunk only.
  If there is a bug that can't wait, fix it in the trunk, test it, and then cherry-pick that fix into the release branch.
  Then make a new tag, where you increase the minor version number.
 
  So in short:
  
  create branch 	trunk -> milestone_12.x
  create tag 		milestone_12.x -> milestone_12.0
  switch main site to milestone_12.0
  ...
  fix major bug in trunk
  apply bugfix to milestone_12.x branch as well
  create new tag milestone_12.x -> milestone_12.1
  switch main site to milestone_12.1

Q: why create a branch and a tag?
The tag is simply a marker for which revision is tested and considered stable.
The branch is there for allowing bugfixes to be added to the stable release, without having to copy any new features over as well.
i.e. a release that is nothing more than the latest tag plus a small bugfix. 
Continued development can go on in the trunk, and bug-fixes can be cherry-picked from the trunk to the release branch.

=== php code ===

The procedure for dealing with the php code is exactly the same as the applet code.
branches/tags for the php code should be made exactly at the same time, and should get exactly the same name.

The reason for doing both together is that it makes the release cycle simpler and more understandable. 
If there isn't confusion about when to test, 
when to develop new features etc. it is more likely that people will actually do these things at the right time.

=== mediawiki code ===
Updates to mediawiki are potentially disruptive. Therefore I propose to these kinds of updates 
on the test site first as well, and always do it before the feature freeze 
so we still have some time for testing.

Mediawiki does major updates quarterly, with a few point releases in between. You can find the
current MediaWiki version on the special page called 'version':
http://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Special:Version

This is an overview of the steps needed to update mediawiki:

**************************************

	Perform the update on a local copy. In this example, the following
	directories are used:

	wikipathways/trunk -> the wikipathways working copy
	mediawiki-1.11.2 -> the mediawiki code of the version used in the
	working copy
	mediawiki-1.12.0 -> the new mediawiki code

	The following steps were taken:
	1. Create a diff of the changes between our code and the current
	mediawiki version code

		diff -c -r mediawiki-1.11.2/ wikipathways/trunk > 1.11_wp_changes.txt

	2. Remove all files in the working copy, except for the svn files and
	pass.php.

		find -! -iwholename "*.svn*" -exec rm -I {} \;

	3. Copy the new mediawiki version to the working copy

		cp -R ../../mediawiki-1.12.0/* .

	4. Restore the wikipathways files in the working copy
	
		svn update

	There might be mediawiki files restored that are removed in the updated
	mediawiki code. To identify these, look at the output from svn update
	and remove any files that belong to mediawiki, using 'svn remove' (e.g.
	files in includes/, language/)

	5. Add all mediawiki files that are included in the update (using 'svn
	add'), use:
	
		svn status

	To check for files that are not in the repository (marked with ?).
	Exceptions are the skins files common and wikipathways.

	5. Apply our changes to the MediaWiki code
	
		patch -c -p1 < ../../1.11_wp_changes.txt

	The output of patch will show if there were any conflicts. Manually
	resolve conflicted files. You can use

		find -iname "*.rej"

	To find the conflicts

	6. Update the MediaWiki database
	
	* Comment out extensions in LocalSettings.php:
	
	these two commands will be helpful:
		sed -i "s/^.*require_once.*wpi.*\$/\#&/" LocalSettings.php
		sed -i "s/^.*require_once.*extensions.*\$/\#&/" LocalSettings.php
	  
	* create AdminSettings.php. You need to fill out username and password for the wikipathways admin user.
	
	* run php maintenance/update.php
	* remove AdminSettings.php
	* restore LocalSettings.php (just revert back to the svn version)

	7. Recompile applets (wikipathways-dest, diffapplet)
	
Note that this workflow does not include updating the custom wikipathways skin. This skin is based on the
monobook skin and changes should be merged seperately:

	1. Merge changes from newest version of skins/MonoBook.php into skins/WikiPathways.php. This is easiest
	done manually with a merge tool (like Meld).
	
	2. Find the difference between the files in the skins/wikipathways directory with the files in the
	mediawiki skins/monobook directory of the *current* mediawiki version:

	diff -c -r mediawiki-1.9.3/skins/monobook /var/www/wikipathways/skins/wikipathways > 1.9.3_wp_skin_changes.diff
	
	3. Overwrite the skin files with the newest monobook files:
	cp mediawiki-1.13.1/skins/monobook/* /var/www/wikipathways/skins/wikipathways/

	4. Apply the WikiPathways specific changes (this may give conflicts, which you need to resolve manually):
	cd /var/www/wikipathways/skins/wikipathways
	patch -p3 < /home/thomas/programs/1.9.3_wp_skin_changes.diff

wpi plugin code     | wikipathways/trunk           | sync after milestone, tags/milestone_x.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


== tagging a release ==

Check if there are any remaining changes on the test site that haven't been checked in.
Check if somebody accicentally changed the stable site

create a milestone branch named milestone_n.x (where n is one higher than the previous branch). 
The milestone branch is useful for cherry-picking, see below.

svn cp http://svn.bigcat.unimaas.nl/wikipathways/trunk 
 http://svn.bigcat.unimaas.nl/wikipathways/branches/milestone_n.x

Next, create a milestone tag named milestone_n.0

svn cp http://svn.bigcat.unimaas.nl/wikipathways/branches/milestone_n.x
 http://svn.bigcat.unimaas.nl/wikipathways/branches/milestone_n.0
 
Now switch the stable site to the tag you just created.

== what to do during feature freeze ==

The test plan is described at: http://conklinwolf.ucsf.edu/genmappwiki/WikiPathways_Test_Plan
Accurately testing the plan requires modifying PathWays, so it should be done on the test site.
This test plan should be performed at least once during feature freeze, but preferably several times on different computers.
Any bugs found during testing should be immediately entered in our bug tracker.

We should pick a list of bugs from mantis, and do nothing but fix those 
(plus newly found ones if they are major)

The advantage of having brief but frequent feature freezes is two fold:
* You are forced once in a while to stop and fix some bugs
* If you only fix bugs, the chance of introducing new bugs at the same time is lower. 
  Otherwise, developers and testers run in eachothers tracks, 
  and a new feature may cause a bug in a part that was just tested.

== cherry-picking ==

It may occur, hopefully not often, that just after a milestone we find a major problem in the stable site.
Instead of syncing early (without going through a round of testing first), we should go through the process
of cherry-picking:

1. A developer confirms the bug on the stable site.
2. A developer confirms the bug on the test site
3. The developer checks in any outstanding changes on the current feature he was working on.
4. The developer fixes the bug. Make sure to create a clean patch. 
   The patch should contain just the changes necessary to fix the problem, no more.
   To save the patch from the command line, run "svn diff > patchfile.txt"
   To save the patch from eclipse, right-click on the project and follow team->create patch
5. confirm that the problem is indeed fixed on the test site
6. Apply the patch to the latest milestone branch (not the tag, a tag should never be changed)
7. create a new tag from the milestone branch, where you increase the last digit. So if the
   last tag was milestone_7.0, the new one should be milestone_7.1
8. the stable site is switched to the newly created tag.

=== Tips: How to keep your diffs clean ===

It is good practice that each time you check in, you only change one aspect at the time.
i.e. try not to mix documentation, general cleanup, bugfixes and features together.
This makes it easier for other to review your changes, and makes it easier to pick up a single set of changes from one line of 
development (.e.g trunk) and apply it to a different line of development (.e.g. a branch)

To see the commits as they are generated, sign up for the commit mailinglist at 
http://groups.google.com/group/wikipathways-commit/

the "diff" that you check in, e.g. the difference between your working copy and the repository 
on the server is as clean as possible. 
That means that the diff should change only one aspect of the program, e.g. clean up, add 

You can always check the current status of your changes with the command "svn diff", or in 
eclipse in team->create patch. Before you commit them.

Here is some background information about diffs, patching, to help you with the process of cherry-picking:

and: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.branchmerge.copychanges.html

=== Other tasks for release time ===

* Update the release notes on http://www.pathvisio.org/Release_Notes

* add a news item on the pathvisio.org main page

* Update the pathvisio webstart
	Make sure webstart/autoftp.conf.template has been filled in and saved as webstart/autoftp.conf 
	(you need to know username / password of the ftp account)
	
	run "ant webstart"

* Update the news item on wikipathways.org

* If there are major new features, do an announcement on wp-announce. If this is a small release, do an announcement on wp-dev=======
